# Colundi Waveforms

128 Colundi frequencies generated using sine, saw and square waves. Each frequency sample has been designed with a minimum length of one second, extending as needed to fully complete a cycle of the waveform, ensuring seamless looping.

## Ableton Devices

One way of playing the sequence quickly is to load all individual samples into an Ableton Sampler device - this then maps the frequencies to individual keys on a conventional MIDI keyboard. An Ableton Live 12 project file is included to demonstrate this.

## Generator Script

There's a simple python script attached to generate the waveforms. Here, you can define your own custom waveforms in addition to the already implemented standard waveforms. You need `numpy` and `soundfile`, using python `3.11`.

## Source
